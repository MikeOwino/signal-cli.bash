*   Don't show notifications for messages that were already read on another device.  Is
    that possible?  Alternatively, don't show notifications for messages that are older
    than a day or so?
*   Retry sending messages a number of times?
*   Don't wait for `signal-cli` to finish when sending messages, i.e., execute it in the
    background?
